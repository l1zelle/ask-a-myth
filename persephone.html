                    It's been a while since we've talked. Is everything all right?</div>

                <div class="message-text">Of course! I was wondering if you could give me some advice though. Can you tell me about how your relationship with Hades started?</div>

                    I don't really tell many people about our relationship, but I trust you</div>

                <div class="message-text">So Hades and I have always had a complicated relationship. We met when I was walking in my favorite flower field. Hades was very bold at that time. He approached me and began making conversation with me. To be honest, I was kind of scared of him. He was intimidating and I've never had a man approach me like that before. But he was captivating to say the least.
                    Nearing the end of our conversation, he wanted to take me back to his home. He persisted and persisted until I finally agreed to follow him to his place.</div>

                <div class="message-text"> I was young and stupid at the time, so yes. Fortunately, he was actually a kind man and cooked me dinner that night! After that, we kept in touch, went on more dates, and I eventually moved in with him</div>
